# Learning goals

-   Learn how data types are coerced in vectors (or columns)
-   Practice creating mixed type vectors
-   Practice using explicit data coercion functions

```{r photo, fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.cap = "Data Importing with readr and readxl", eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/readr.png")
knitr::include_graphics("img/readxl.png")
```

# Getting started

If you're looking at these instructions you've already done the following steps, but as a reminder:

-   Go to the course GitHub organization and locate your Unit 3 repo, which should be named `unit-5-YOUR_LAST_NAME`.
-   Grab the URL of the repo, and clone it in RStudio.
-   First, open the R Markdown instructions `lab-O5-import-recode.Rmd` and the lab starter `lab-05.Rmd` and Knit them
-   Make sure they compile without errors.

## Data

For this lab, we will be using the `earthquakes` dataset from the `{openintro}` package we have used before and we will also need `{tidyverse}` for some data wrangling.

## Packages

The package `{readr}` is automatically loaded with the `tidyverse`.
`{readxl}` is also part of the `tidyverse` but it is not automatically loaded.

```{r message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(openintro)
```

## Warm up

Before we start the lab, let's warm up by changing the YAML in the starter file:

-   Update the YAML, changing the author name to your name, and **knit** the document. üß∂
-   Commit your changes with a meaningful commit message. ‚úÖ
-   Push your changes to GitHub.Ô∏è ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
-   Go to your repo on GitHub and confirm that your changes are visible in your Rmd files.

# Lab Exercises

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

Let's first load the data:

```{r label-me1, eval=FALSE}
nobel <- ___(___)
```

Then let's split the data into two:

```{r label-me2, eval=FALSE}
# stem laureates
___ <- nobel %>%
  filter(___)

# non-steam laureates
___ <- nobel %>%
  filter(___)
```

And finally write out the data:

```{r label-me3}
# add code for writing out the two data frames here
```

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

-   Read in the Excel file called `sales.xlsx` from the `data-raw/` folder such that it looks like the following.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="20%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sales-1.png")
```

```{r}

```

-   **Stretch goal:** Manipulate the sales data such such that it looks like the following.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="25%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sales-2.png")
```

```{r}

```

üß∂ ‚úÖ ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Knit, *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.*
