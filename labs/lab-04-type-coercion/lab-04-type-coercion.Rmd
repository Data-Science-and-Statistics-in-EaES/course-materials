# Learning goals

-   Learn how data types are coerced in vectors (or columns)
-   Practice creating mixed type vectors
-   Practice using explicit data coercion functions

```{r photo, fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.cap = "Data Coercion Figure - Hands-on Programming in R G. Grolemund", eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/data-coercion.png")
```

# Getting started

If you're looking at these instructions you've already done the following steps, but as a reminder:

-   Go to the course GitHub organization and locate your Unit 3 repo, which should be named `lab-4-YOUR_LAST_NAME`.
-   Grab the URL of the repo, and clone it in RStudio.
-   First, open the R Markdown instructions `lab-O4-type-coercion.Rmd` and the lab starter `lab-04.Rmd` and Knit them
-   Make sure they compile without errors.

## Data

For the first 3 exercises, we will use data objects we will create ourselves.
The last 3 exercises will use the `earthquakes` dataset from the `{openintro}` package we have used before.

## Packages

```{r message = FALSE}
library(openintro)
```

## Warm up

Before we start the lab, let's warm up by changing the YAML in the starter file:

-   Update the YAML, changing the author name to your name, and **knit** the document. üß∂
-   Commit your changes with a meaningful commit message. ‚úÖ
-   Push your changes to GitHub.Ô∏è ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
-   Go to your repo on GitHub and confirm that your changes are visible in your Rmd files.

1.  Copy the three code chunks below into Exercise 1 in your Lab 04 starter file. Beneath the **first** code chunk, add text narrative to state what the data type is for each object. Beneath the **second** code chunk, add text narrative explaining why the output of the first code chunk is different from the second. Finally, uncomment the code (remove `#`) in the **third** code chunk, and add text narrative stating and *explaining* the data type of the vector.

**NOTE** Don't worry about code chunk labels in this Lab *unless* we tell you to add them.

-   Vector `c(1, 1L, "C")`

```{r}
1
1L
"C"
```

```{r}
c(1, 1L, "C")
```

```{r}
#typeof(c(1, 1L, "C"))
```

2.  Copy the next two code chunks below into Exercise 2 in your Lab 04 starter file. Beneath the **first** code chunk, add text narrative to state what the data type is for each object. Then, uncomment the code (remove `#`) in the **second** code chunk, and add text narrative stating and *explaining* the data type of the vector.

-   Vector `c(1:3, 5)`

```{r}
1:3
5
```

```{r}
#typeof(c(1:3, 5))
```

3.  Copy the next two code chunks below into Exercise 3 in your Lab 04 starter file. Beneath the **first** code chunk, add text narrative to state what the data type is for each object. Then, uncomment the code (remove `#`) in the **second** code chunk, and add text narrative stating and *explaining* the data type of the vector.

-   Vector `c(3, FALSE, T)`

```{r}
3 
FALSE
T
```

```{r}
#typeof(c(3, FALSE, T))
```

4.  Copy the next two code chunks below into Exercise 4 in your Lab 04 starter file. Beneath the **first** code chunk, add text narrative to state what the data type is for each object. Then, uncomment the code (remove `#`) in the **second** code chunk, and add text narrative stating and *explaining* the data type of the vector.

-   Vector `c(TRUE, as.numeric(TRUE))`

```{r}
TRUE
as.numeric(TRUE)
```

```{r}
#typeof(c(TRUE, as.numeric(TRUE)))
```

5.  Copy the next two code chunks below into Exercise 5 in your Lab 04 starter file. Beneath the **first** code chunk, add text narrative to state what the data type is for each object. Then, uncomment the code (remove `#`) in the **second** code chunk, and add text narrative stating and *explaining* the data type of the vector.
-   Vector `c(NA, FALSE, as.logical(1))`

```{r}
NA
FALSE
as.logical(1)
```

```{r}
#typeof(c(NA, FALSE, as.logical(1)))
```

6.  Copy the next two code chunks below into Exercise 6 in your Lab 04 starter file. Beneath the **first** code chunk, add text narrative to state what the data type is for each object (*include the numerator and denominator of the division, separately, as well as the overall division operation together*). Then, uncomment the code (remove `#`) in the **second** code chunk, and add text narrative stating and *explaining* the data type of the vector.

-   Vector `c(1L / 0, "A")`

```{r}
1L
0
1L / 0
"A"
```

```{r}
#typeof(c(1L / 0, "A"))
```
