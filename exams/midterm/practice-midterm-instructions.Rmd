```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval = TRUE)
```

## Data

```{r photo, fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 3, fig.cap = "Chicago temperatures - February 2021", eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/feb-2021-cold.jpeg")
```

We will be working with data downloaded from [Weather Underground](https://www.wunderground.com/) for three stations:

-   The Loop - `chicago-loop.csv`
-   Southloop - `chicago-south-loop.csv`
-   Oak Park - `chicago-oak-park.csv`

Each dataset has daily min, average, and max temperatures for each day in February 2021.
This was one of the coldest and snowiest Februarys in recent Chicago history!

## Packages

We will need `{dplyr}` and `{purrr}` package functions from the tidyverse, and date functions from `lubridate`.

```{r message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
```

## Warm up

Before we introduce the data, let's warm up with some simple exercises.

-   Update the YAML, changing the author name to your name, and **knit** the document.
-   Commit your changes with a meaningful commit message.
-   Push your changes to GitHub.
