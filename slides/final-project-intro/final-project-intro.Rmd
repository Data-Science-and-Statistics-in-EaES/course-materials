# Final Project Overview

---

## Why?

- Mimic the project-based work and skills of a real data scientist.  
- Figure out how to identify a dataset.
- Apply your skills to a dataset of your choosing, including EAESy data.  
- Because this should be more useful (and fun?) than a big final exam.

---

## How?

**(1) Pick a dataset and apply the data science work flow**

```{r setup, echo=FALSE, fig.align="middle", out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/data-science-cycle.001.png")
```

---

## How?

(1) Pick a dataset and apply the data science work flow

**(2) Conduct a focused (not exhaustive) analysis**

Demonstrate you can...
1. Ask a question and answer it with the data analysis results
2. Code in R and can combine code with text to produce .Rmd reports
3. Interpret and communicate analysis results

---

## How?

(1) Pick a dataset and apply the data science work flow

(2) Conduct a focused (not exhaustive) analysis

**(3) Do whatever you want, but use `tidyverse` packages in R+RStudio**

**(5) Collaboratively, in small groups (Grad students: independent option)**

---

## What?

Each group (or grad student) will complete a:
 
- **Proposal (20 pts)**: One page (max) using RMarkdown describing your (1) dataset, (2) exploratory visualization, and (3) one question you may pose and some tidyverse methods that may help answer it.

- **Presentation (50 pts)**: 5 minutes (max) using RMarkdown and the `xaringan` package. Each group member can contribute (1-2 slides each). Focus on telling the story of your analysis (what choices did you make, and why), not all the different things you tried. 

- **Report (30 pts)**: Provide a brief summary of your project in the README of your Github repo. 

**Style and format does matter, so make sure your code and outputs look good!**


---

## When? 

- Proposal (20 pts) **Work on it today: Due next Wednesday at midnight!**

- Presentation (50 pts) **During our "final exam" slot in Finals week: Dec 6-10 (4 weeks away)**

- Report (30 pts) **Due end of finals week at midnight (Friday Dec 10th)**

**Timeline**
- Week 12: This week!
- Week 13: Unit 7: Fitting Models
- Week 14: Unit 8: Hypothesis Testing (+ Thanksgiving!)
- **Week 15: Work on final projects both days**
- Week 16: Project presentations; Report due.

**We will also do 15 min group check-ins at the start of class each Wednesday!**

## (2) Pick a dataset with our assistance!
#### From our options or somewhere else (NASA, NOAA, WMO, Dryad, etc.)
#### From your own project (grad students only!)

## Discuss your options/interests as a group

---


## (3) Self-organize! 
#### How will you divvy up the proposal? 
#### How/where/when will you meet outside of class?

## Take 3 minutes to think about 5 "challenges" during this project 

---


## (4) Start working on the proposal!
#### Fork the group repo and familiarize yourselves with the files
#### Add to your proposal > commit > push > create pull request > merge.

## A reminder: Your proposal will need to include...
- A description of the dataset including a data dictionary
- A exploratory visualization figure (with some narrative)
- A question you could pose and a possible method for answering
